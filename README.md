# holiday-reservation-system-project

This Hotel Booking System project is a distributed enterprise-scale software system, which provides features for reserving hotel rooms, checking-in, pricing calculation, exception report handling etc.

It comprises of a management client to manage the employees and rooms, a reservation client to be used by guests, as well as an externally-linked external partner reservation system, which is utilised by companies like travel agencies and price comparison websites.

This project is developed in Java using Jakarta Enterprise Edition (Jakarta EE). 
In particular, Jakarta Enterprise Beans (EJB) and Jakarta Persistence API (JPA) technologies are used in conjunction with a MySQL Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), using Eclipse GlassFish Server. 

We also utilised Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) Web Services to connect the external partner reservation system to the software components, and applied forward engineering technique to generate the physical data model, with the overall project running as a Command-line Interface (CLI) client application.
